# 05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler
This weeks assignment consisted of making a working workday scheduler that saved the input text  to the timeblock via setting and retriving the information within the localstorage.
the first thing that i did was add the time block for the user to input the desired information in the .html file.
after that was done, i moved on to the script.js file. I started buy adding the moments.js syntax to display the proper date and time up top.
I then added an event listener for the save button to where once clicked it saves the users text input to local storage.
after that i made if statment to get the information from local storage and put it in the . description textarea of the html file,
then i made a function checks the current time and changes the current time and adds past, present, or future classes depending on what the current time is
